# Semester 1: Ancient Philosophy

## Duration

16 weeks (4 months)

## Overview

This semester establishes the foundation for everything that follows. Plato and Aristotle don't just begin Western philosophy—they establish its central problems, distinctions, and methods. Every subsequent philosopher is, in some sense, responding to them.

You cannot understand Hegel without understanding Plato's forms. You cannot understand Heidegger without understanding Aristotle on being. You cannot understand the Frankfurt School's critique of instrumental reason without understanding how reason was first conceived.

Read slowly. Read carefully. These texts will return throughout the program.

## Semester Goals

By the end of this semester, you will:

1. Have read substantial portions of Plato's major dialogues and Aristotle's central works
2. Understand the fundamental problems of ancient philosophy: being, knowledge, the good, the soul, the polis
3. Be able to articulate the key differences between Platonic and Aristotelian approaches
4. Have developed the skill of close reading that all subsequent philosophy requires
5. Have written approximately 20,000 words of philosophical prose
