## What is OpenGrad?

OpenGrad offers rigorous, multi-year programs of study modeled on doctoral programs at top institutions. Each program is:

- **Graduate-level** — Equivalent in depth, rigor, and comprehensiveness to a doctoral program
- **Self-paced** — 10-15 hours/week alongside full-time work
- **AI-facilitated** — Curriculum designed with AI, writing evaluated by AI, discussion deepened by AI
- **Non-credentialed** — No degree, no certificate—only genuine formation
- **Primary sources** — Read alone, in silence, without assistance

## How It Works

You read alone. You write alone. You struggle alone. The AI never intervenes during your encounter with primary texts—no summaries, no explanations, no interpretations handed to you. The difficulty is the point.

**AI operates at the level of program, not at the level of reading.**

The AI serves as curriculum designer, Socratic interlocutor, rigorous evaluator, and examiner—but only after you've done your own work.
