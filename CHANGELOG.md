**Status**: accepted

**Change**: Program restructured from interdisciplinary critical theory to rigorous continental philosophy PhD

**Rationale**: Original program was designed around Frankfurt School and critical theory, starting with foundations (Plato, Marx, Freud) and moving directly to 20th-century material.

Upon reflection, student requested a program modeled on actual top-tier PhD programs. Discovery: elite Anglophone programs (Harvard, Princeton, NYU) are predominantly analytic philosophy, which doesn't align with student's interests. Continental philosophy programs (New School, Penn State, Stony Brook, European universities) provide the right model.

New structure:
- Year 1: Philosophical Foundations (Ancient, Modern)
- Year 2: The Continental Turn (German Idealism, Phenomenology)
- Year 3: Critical Theory and French Thought (Frankfurt School, Post-Structuralism)
- Year 4: Specialization (Psychoanalysis, Independent Research)

This delays the student's core interests (Frankfurt School, psychoanalysis) until Year 3 but provides genuinely rigorous foundation. When student reads Adorno, they will understand what he's responding to.

English translations only. No language requirement.
